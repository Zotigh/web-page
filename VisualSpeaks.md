* (First picture) This is how I think of my life right now. 
Everything is uncertain I see the path that I need to take but there are so many holes everywhere. 
I feel like one wrong move and its all over. 
The only thing I have to do is overcome all of this, which I am no stranger to. 

* (Second picture) This is my light at the end of the tunnel. 
Everyone just wants to be free. I am no different in that way. 
No one tells the clouds how they should be formed. 
Much like how I want my future to be.
