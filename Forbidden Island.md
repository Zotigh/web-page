## Forbidden Island 

* Our game was still up in the air as to wheither or not we would win. We thought about alot of the possibilities and we were dealt 
bad hands but we worked though them and as a group came up with solutions. We each brought something to the table our floodcount was up 
in the fours but I was confident in my team that we could have worked it out.
