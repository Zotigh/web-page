## Forbidden Island 

* Our game was still up in the air as to whether or not we would win. We thought about alot of the possibilities and though we were dealt very unfortinate hands, we worked though them and as a group came up with solutions. Despite our floodcount being in the fours, I was confident in my team that we would have pervailed.
