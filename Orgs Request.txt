## ICON CINEMAS
* This company has a webpage that offers online services to purchase tickets but not a android app that does this. 
That is where I would come in to offer my services. The web service gives its developer 1$ each time it is used. 
I would like pay based on this same pricipal.  


## CONCETTA D. GALLERY (Ran by Connie Farley)
* This Company does not have a App and I could offer them one that displays there galleries art work. 
My expected pay would be the publicity and a addition to my resume. In terms of actual monetary pay I
would think that a painting in exchange would be ok since they are worth quite a amount.(I like paintings)
