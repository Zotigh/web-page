# Collabiration questions
## What role do you play in a team? What are your triggers? How do you communicate with others?
* My role in a team is usually that of glue. I take various parts and put them together. The role in this group seems to be about that as I am 
will be focusing on the DataBase aspect of the project. 
* My "trigger/s" would have to be non cooperation, non communtication, and to many excuses
* I beleive I communicate ok as in the past at my old job I was always put on the head table at the event and that required much communication from 
me to my manager.
