* (First picture) This is how I think of my life right now. 
Everything is uncertain I see the path that I need to take but there are so many holes everywhere. 
I feel like one wrong move and its all over. 
The only thing I have to do is overcome all of this, which I am no stranger to. 

* (Second picture) This is my light at the end of the tunnel. 
Everyone just wants to be free. I am no different in that way. 
No one tells the clouds how they should be formed. 
Much like how I want my future to be.

### Elevator Pitch 
		
+ Hello my name is Lance. My aim is to make well made programs across multiple platforms 
   utilizing what I have learned. I do this so I may have a better future for everyone. I plan to
   use the coding skills I have learned to help acomplish this. Are you interested in the same thing?

## Weekly Reflections

* (Week 1) I learned about how methods are invoked to create functions in a system. After starting this week I feel
   more knolegable if by a little about java code. This makes me feel even if a little acomplished. I look
   forward to continuing and hope I can learn as much as the instructer has to offer.
   
* (Week 2) Learning about structures and the most efficent ways to set them up is something I really find interesting. This is something I know will benefit me when implimented in the future. This is also helping cement my mind in a more constructive manner twards commputer programming and its structure. I can only get better and aim to.
