### Elevator Pitch 
		
+ Hello my name is Lance. My aim is to make well made programs across multiple platforms 
   utilizing what I have learned. I do this so I may have a better future for everyone. I plan to
   use the coding skills I have learned to help acomplish this. Are you interested in the same thing?

## Weekly Reflections

* (Week 1) I learned about how methods are invoked to create functions in a system. After starting this week I feel
   more knolegable if by a little about java code. This makes me feel even if a little acomplished. I look
   forward to continuing and hope I can learn as much as the instructer has to offer.
   
* (Week 2) Learning about structures and the most efficent ways to set them up is something I really find interesting. This is something I know will benefit me when implimented in the future. This is also helping cement my mind in a more constructive manner twards commputer programming and its structure. I can only get better and aim to.

* (Week 3) Beginning to learn to use DataBases this week is really a thing I know will help me in my path to becoming a compiuter developer. Since this is something I'm taking a liking to I know it will make me more valueable as a up and coming computer programmer if I can master it.  

* (week 4) Furthering my knowledge of how to debug a problem and fix it was something I did very well in this week. I know this will be a key in helping me make efficent bug free apps for my clients.
